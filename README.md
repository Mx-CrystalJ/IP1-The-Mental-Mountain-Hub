## Project Outline

The Mental Mountain Hub is a fictional organisation dedicated to the support of bettering the mental health of society members, focusing on providing a free guide to obtaining good mental health and regonising common signs. The page I created takes advantage of the idea that natrure is calming and a great way to turn looking after yoursef into a constant natural habit.

The final deployment fufils the requirements being responsive to modern device standards, adheres to accessibility requirements and is aesthetically pleasing with a focus on needs and well-being.

### Key Objectives

- The user experience requires me to utilise effective navigation and layout in order to provide simplicity and calming effects.
- Clear presentation of content with options for more information.
- Responsive design adhering to standards and accessibility.
- Color and imagery considers the well-being of the end user.

## UX Design

## User Stories

Adults - I want to know the best way to improve and learn about my mental health so I can feel confident knowing that I am doing everything I can beyond waiting for referals to services. I want to easily find resources to support my self-help journey and possibly find other services that can be used.

Students - I want to find resources that help me when I am feeling overwhelmed, anxious, stressed or depressed. I want to be able to talk to be abe to find resources to services where I can talk to someone when I am worried and need help managing my mental health.

Medical Professionals - I want to be able to reassure paitents that there are services that provide a safe and comforting environment with accurate and detailed information presented in a way that allows my paitents to futher their thirst for knowledge that will benifit their physical and mental health. I want to be an easy point of access to these resources that will supplement sessions and care plans by explaining anxiety, depression, ect.

## Colors

Color selection is a key component to any design process, however with the nature of the project this consideration is even greater because of the improtant nature of mental health to the end user, there is a possibilty for negatively impacting their well-being, mental health and contibuting to trauma by overwhlming them hence the need for using as little colour for the background as necessary to keep the flow.

The artwork of this project was essential in creating a welcoming and appropriate page for the end user and their specific needs. Combining general color theory in white space, mental health specific color theory, my own personal experience of bettering mental health, I was able to determine an appropriate color scheme that is aesthetically pleasing, calming and engaging.

To ensure compliance to standards, the [Colour Contrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/) (also available as extension on [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colour-contrast-checker/nmmjeclfkgjdomacpcflgdkgpphpmnfe)) was used.<br>
Both the [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) and the [Adobe](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) color contrast tools were used to corroborate these results.

### Main Palette

- Cyan `#a9ebe8` `--cyan light blue`
- Light Blue `#E4B7E5` `--light blue`
- White `#ffffff` `--white`
- Light Green `#efefeb` `--light green`

Due to the potential impact of color on mental health, additional research and feedback was sought out in order to ensure an appropriate selection was made for this project. Aditional research in the documentation for additional [research](/documentation/research.md).

## Fonts

When looking in Google Fonts I wanted to ensure a positive user experience whilst visiting the page in which they wuld be able to clearly see the sections and headings.<br>
Two sans-serif fonts were selected for the project, and implemented via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) using a direct import code within the style.css file.

[Lexend Giga](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Giga) ois a crisp and clear font used within logos, headings other page elements that need to be seen as important by the user.

[Prompt](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Prompt) is the primary content font ensuring content importance and complementing the Lexend Giga font choice by being slightly bigger and thicker than the headings.

### Wireframes

These low-fidelity wireframes have been created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to define the key feature layout to guide the user experience design. Utilising the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework and available components allows for ease of navigation and structured content with a responsive design.

## Imagery

The image selection became a key influence in the design of the overall project, including naming and branding.

With the requirements of the end user in mind, I sought out images that would fulfil specific criteria;
- Strong thematic link that could be used for branding purposes
- Easily identifiable and appealing to the target audience
- Promote inclusivity
- Have wide variety for appropriate use and relevance across project
- Adhere to color research to maintain user well-being

After seeking out many options including animal images in the same style, I opted to use the Astronaut.

This selection of images fulfilled the criteria set out and offered further inspiration. 
- Astronaut character maintains consistent theme and works well as brand image and name
- Usage of the same character makes the images eaily identifiable and has a fun and playful appeal
- Adopting research that has been applied to comic book superheroes, the use of a mask to hide identity allows the character to adopt universal representation and inclusivity
- The images available using this character was great in number (more than included here) which would allow for relevant inclusion across the project and future implementation
- The images not only adhered to the color requirements, but also informed minor adjustments to the color palette

- Astronaut Artwork: Designed by [Freepik](http://www.freepik.com/) - Following [Attributation Policy](https://support.freepik.com/s/article/Attribution-How-when-and-where?language=en_US)

During my process of seeking out feedback for UX my decision to include the astronaut character based up on the anonymity and thus inclusivity was confirmed to be a positive one.

## Features

### General Features

In order to fulfil the criteria the page consists of various sectioned information each with a variety of links, resources and other elements that contribute to a positive user experience. 

Upon coding the project, receiving feedback and implementing the [Bootstrap Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) the features and design shifted slightly from the original wireframe.

Some key adjustments: 

- The inclusion of buttons within the hero section.<br>
This was done to reflect the clearly definied section of content and provide the user an easy navigation link to the section they would most likely be seeking to interact with. 

- Opting not centre all content within their respective parents.<br>
This decision was made as a result of personal reflection and user feedback to provide a more enjoyable user experience.

#### Navigation and Hero Section

I chose to use a bold and welcoming hero section for the start of the page using the [Bootstrap Jumbotron](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/jumbotron/)

This gives a clear indication of the content as well as imagery that links to the brand and identity of the organisation.

Within this section I have included two buttons that present easy to navigate options for the user to access the relevant section of the page for their needs.

The navigation bar is a Bootstrap component that allows for easy navigation around the site using a familiar method for a positive user experience.

![Navigation & Hero](/documentation/images/nav-and-hero.webp)

#### Bootstrap Cards

I opted to utilise the [Bootstrap Card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/) feature for the main content of the page as this allowed for a clean organisation of the information. 

Within these sections I have also opted to provide additional resources, links and access to contact modals via buttons for ease.

For balance I also gave the cards a consistent height by adding the `h-100` class.

![Cards](/documentation/images/cards.webp)

#### Policies Section

Mirroring the design of the hero section, I have included a safeguarding policies section for the organisation giving basic details and providing a link to download the policy in full. 

This section not only serves as a vital area for information, but also as a visual divider between the card sections aimed at parents and their families. 

![Policies Section](/documentation/images/policies.webp)

#### Footer

For the footer again I implemented a [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/footers/) component.

Here I have used the bold contrast of the purple to distinguish it apart from the rest of the page allowing it to be easily identifiable across the whole website.

The information provided in this section is considered somewhat standard and provides for a user experience that is easy to understand. 

#### Links and Buttons

Although the page used a variety of colours for buttons to adhere to contrast requirements, each link and button does maintain a level of consistency by utilising the `var(--blue)` as part of it's `:hover` status in some way.

### Responsive Design

Utilising the [Bootstrap Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) allowed for an implementation that is responsive without the need for additional CSS or media queries.

Though it took some experimentation and troubleshooting, I have been able to create a page that is fully responsive to modern standards.

This has proven to be a very valuable learning experience in the use of frameworks.
As a result of my debugging within Dev Tools in order to identify and resolve responsiveness issues I believe I have a much greater understanding of how to adpat Bootstrap for use within future projects. 

During testing it was apparent that `display-6` was too large for the navbar brand text so this was removed to increase responsivity.
